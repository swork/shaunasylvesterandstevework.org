          We are getting excited about hosting you for our wedding in
          a few weeks. We wanted to give you an update of our plans
          and outline some important details:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Getting here</b>: Please remember to travel with your
              <b>PASSPORT</b>. Unless you are coming by a charter flight from
              Bellingham or by boat directly from the US, you will
              need to cross the border. In the case of those who are
              driving from the US, you'll need to cross at the Peace
              Arch (or truck) crossing and then again at the Point
              Roberts crossing. If you are traveling mid-day when
              line-ups are long, you'll wish you had a Nexus pass.
            </p>
            <p>
              One piece of advice is to try and avoid peak border
              crossing times. Earlier in the day is usually better,
              mid-day worst. Arrive early if you come Saturday.  We
              also recommend not bringing food or alcohol across. You
              can get everything you need on the Point. And while both
              BC (and the rest of Canada) and Washington State have
              decriminalized cannabis, please be very aware that the
              USA federal government has not.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please be clear if asked that you are a guest at our
              wedding, not a worker. The caterers are USA citizens
              from Bellingham. These questions are likely.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Staying here:</b> We mentioned in our invitation that
              we have activities planned for those of you who can
              spend the weekend with us. It's a long weekend for
              Canadians and some guests are planning on staying
              through to Monday. If you want to stay on to Monday and
              you have confirmed reservations with us at the
              campground, then please let us know
              (<a href="mailto:steve@work.renlabs.com">steve@work.renlabs.com</a>)
              so that we can make plans to extend your stay by one
              night (currently we have booked sites for Friday and
              Saturday night).
            </p>
            <p>
              Our apologies that we are fully booked for the
              Lighthouse Marine Park campground, but if you don’t yet
              have reservations with us and you want to bring your RV
              or tent please contact
              the <a href="https://www.sunnypointrvpark.com">Sunny
              Point Resort</a>. They may have additional spaces
              available. <a href="https://www.sunnypointrvpark.com">https://www.sunnypointrvpark.com</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you prefer to book an Airbnb or VRBO, there may be
              some opportunities available (although friends tell me
              it has gotten very tight for this weekend). Tsawwassen,
              which is located just on the other side of the border,
              has hotels and resorts. The only drawback is having to
              cross the border, but if you time it right, it can be
              easy.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Cell coverage and wifi:</b> Cell coverage isn’t great
              in Point Roberts unless you have Verizon or you are
              hanging out on the beach. It may be possible to connect
              to the internet at the library, cafes or pub. If you are
              desperate, we have wifi at the cabin.

                    Many people will be arriving on Friday. If you are
                    arriving early to avoid the crowds, there is lots
                    to do on the Point - there are great walks at Lily
                    Point - bird watching – over 140 different species
                    can be found (there are access points to beaches
                    at all four corners of the point and you’ll see
                    eagles’ nests throughout the area)
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Point Roberts golf course is open and it’s
                        getting good reviews (be sure to book your tee

                        closed down last summer. We have some personal
                        bikes to lend out (though are short of locks
                        and helmets! - bring some if you can!)

                </dt>
                <dd>
                  Our events get underway at the Community Centre on
                  Gulf Road (1487 Gulf Road next to the library). We
                  are inviting everyone to join us for a music party,
                  games night and a celebration of two big birthdays -
                  Gerry Sylvester (Shauna’s dad) 90th birthday and
                  Sharon Work (Steve’s mom) 79th birthday - as well as
                  creating a space for the musicians among us to jam
                  (bring your instruments) and the pool sharks, hearts
                  or bridge lovers and board game enthusiasts to
                  gather. It will be a casual night to get to know
                  each other. Join us for some conversation, good
                  beer, wine, punch, munchies, cake and a few
                  toasts. Dress is casual and kids are most welcome.

                  We feel a little bit like the Little Rascals putting
                  on a show, but we recognize it takes a village to
                  host a wedding… so for those who are interested and
                  able, we will be hosting a volunteer set-up party at
                  the old cannery (soon to be Blackfish Resort) the
                  site of the wedding.

                      Rowan Sylvester is taking the lead in
                      co-ordinating the set up of the space for the
                      wedding. We’ll be putting up curtains and
                      lights, setting up tables, arranging flowers,
                      decorating, putting up signage, organizing sound
                      and preparing for the space for the ceremony,
                      reception and dinner. There are lots of
                      opportunities to get involved, meet new people
                      and help us prepare to host everyone.

                      12noon to 2pm – Croquet, bocce or
                      ultimate anyone?

                    <dd>
                      If it is sunny, we’re convening at the local
                      community playing field for a little R&amp;R.
                      There is a good kids playground area, lots of
                      shade and room to run. And for those who are
                      feeling a little competitive – there’s croquet
                      and bocce – and, if we have the numbers -
                      pick-up Ultimate. NOT A POTLUCK as we don't want
                      people frustrated at the border discovering what
                      food can or can't cross (we can't keep it
                      straight, and we cross here frequently!) We'll
                      have sandwich fixings for lunch, please don't
                      worry about bringing anything.

                        The wedding ceremony, reception, dinner and
                        dancing will be held at the old cannery at the
                        "coming soon Blackfish Resort", 755 Marine
                        Drive.  There is ample parking there or next
                        door at the Lighthouse Marine Park. It’s a
                        rather rustic place with minimal facilities
                        (yes, there will be bathrooms on site).  Steve
                        O’Neil the proprietor has secured permitting
                        to develop the space into a micro-brewery, spa
                        and resort, but for now it’s a weathered
                        yellow building shell located on the south
                        western shoreline of Point Roberts.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The ceremony will be outdoors and if it is
                        sunny and hot, we recommend wearing a hat and
                        glasses. We will have a small area under a
                        tent reserved for our elders.  (Please let us
                        know if you need to be sheltered from the sun
                        during the ceremony).  Our close friend and
                        celebrant Marcia Thomson will be leading us
                        through the ceremony.

                      <p>
                        Dress is a bit casual. Ceremony surface is dry
                        grass and rocky sandy soil, not great for
                        heels. Besides, you'll want to dance later.

                      <p>
                        After the ceremony, we are asking everyone to
                        gather for a group picture on the grounds.

                      Immediately after the ceremony the reception bar

                      When it looks like the bar-b-que chefs are ready
                      for us, our MC Louise Smith will call us in to
                      be seated for a family-style dinner. We’ve
                      developed a menu that we hope will satisfy the
                      needs of everyone but please let us know if you
                      have any food allergies or dietary restrictions
                      (<a href="mailto:shauna.sylvester@gmail.com">shauna.sylvester@gmail.com</a>).
                      After dinner, we’ll cut the cake, have a few
                      toasts and start the dancing. Please send us
                      your favourite dance music recommendations

                      and we’ll curate them into a great playlist.

                        On Sunday we are going to take it easy. For
                        those who would like to join us for morning
                        coffee, we’ll be watching for whales from the
                        covered picnic area at the Lighthouse Marine
                        Park.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We are going to take the day to relax, visit
                        and explore the Point Roberts beaches. If you
                        haven’t had a chance to go golfing, bird
                        watching, hiking or cycling, it’s a great way
                        to spend a sunny Sunday.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For those who are staying the night, we’ll
                        gather at our cabin at 671 Bells Grove for
                        dinner at 7pm.  A couple of notes about
                        visiting us at our cabin – there isn’t much
                        parking on Bells Grove so it’s best to walk or
                        cycle and park elsewhere.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you do come down in a car, please stay
                        within the 10mph speed zone (or face the wrath
                        of our neighbours) and DO NOT park on the
                        central boulevard. Our drainage system sits at
                        about 2cm from the surface and someone once
                        parked on the boulevard causing a huge break,
                        which created a river that washed out our road
                        (such are the joys of rural life). We have
                        permission from some of our neighbours to use
                        their parking spot so we’ll find a space for
                        you, or you can park in the church lot which
                        is a block to the east of Bells Grove on APA
                        road.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If it is warm enough, we’re hoping to spend
                        the evening at the beach. Let us know if you
                        are going to join us on Sunday evening so we
                        can get a sense of numbers.

                    We’ll be departing from Point Roberts in the
                    afternoon on Monday to get ready for our honeymoon
                    trip. We’re off to hike the 180k Tour de Mont
                    Blanc in Switzerland, Italy and France. We look
                    forward to spending time with family and friends
                    Monday morning at the cabin.

          We hope we’ve covered all the details. Let us know if you
          have any questions or specific needs. If you are stuck for
          accommodation, we have a friend who would be happy to host a
          guest or two in their home and perhaps some tents on their
          property. Please let us know and we will connect you.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are really looking forward to welcoming you to Point
          Roberts and to the wedding. Please, no gifts, we have
          everything we need! Just come, dance and celebrate with us
          and enjoy a beachside weekend.
